Our goal isn't to train a really elaborate model that achieves state-of-the-art performance -- although we'll give you code to do that later! -- but rather to dip a toe into using TensorFlow. As such, we're going to start with a very simple model, called a Softmax Regression."

    "## Important points about MNIST:\n",
    "1) Every MNIST data point has two parts: an image of a handwritten digit and a corresponding label. We'll call the images \"x\" and the labels \"y\". Both the training set and test set contain images and their corresponding labels.\n",
    "2) Each image is 28 pixels by 28 pixels. We can interpret this as a big array of numbers\n",
    "3) We can flatten this array into a vector of 28x28 = 784 numbers. It doesn't matter how we flatten the array, as long as we're consistent between images. From this perspective, the MNIST images are just a bunch of points in a 784-dimensional vector space, with a very rich structure (warning: computationally intensive visualizations).\n",
    "4) Flattening the data throws away information about the 2D structure of the image. Isn't that bad? Well, the best computer vision methods do exploit this structure, and we will in later tutorials. But the simple method we will be using here, a softmax regression (defined below), won't.\n",
    "5) Each image in MNIST has a corresponding label, a number between 0 and 9 representing the digit drawn in the image.\n",
    "6) For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to want our labels as \"one-hot vectors\". A one-hot vector is a vector which is 0 in most dimensions, and 1 in a single dimension. In this case, the nth digit will be represented as a vector which is 1 in the nth dimension. For example, 3 would be [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

    "## Softmax Regression:\n",
    "We know that every image in MNIST is of a handwritten digit between zero and nine. So there are only ten possible things that a given image can be. We want to be able to look at an image and give the probabilities for it being each digit. For example, our model might look at a picture of a nine and be 80% sure it's a nine, but give a 5% chance to it being an eight (because of the top loop) and a bit of probability to all the others because it isn't 100% sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic case where a softmax regression is a natural, simple model. If you want to assign probabilities to an object being one of several different things, softmax is the thing to do, because softmax gives us a list of values between 0 and 1 that add up to 1. Even later on, when we train more sophisticated models, the final step will be a layer of softmax.\n",
    "\n",
    "A softmax regression has two steps: first we add up the evidence of our input being in certain classes, and then we convert that evidence into probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tally up the evidence that a given image is in a particular class, we do a weighted sum of the pixel intensities. The weight is negative if that pixel having a high intensity is evidence against the image being in that class, and positive if it is evidence in favor.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it's often more helpful to think of softmax the first way: exponentiating its inputs and then normalizing them. The exponentiation means that one more unit of evidence increases the weight given to any hypothesis multiplicatively. And conversely, having one less unit of evidence means that a hypothesis gets a fraction of its earlier weight. No hypothesis ever has zero or negative weight. Softmax then normalizes these weights, so that they add up to one, forming a valid probability distribution. (To get more intuition about the softmax function, check out the section on it in Michael Nielsen's book, complete with an interactive visualization.)"

    "To do efficient numerical computing in Python, we typically use libraries like NumPy that do expensive operations such as matrix multiplication outside Python, using highly efficient code implemented in another language. Unfortunately, there can still be a lot of overhead from switching back to Python every operation. This overhead is especially bad if you want to run computations on GPUs or in a distributed manner, where there can be a high cost to transferring data.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow also does its heavy lifting outside Python, but it takes things a step further to avoid this overhead. Instead of running a single expensive operation independently from Python, TensorFlow lets us describe a graph of interacting operations that run entirely outside Python.
